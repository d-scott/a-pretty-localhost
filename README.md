# A Prettified Localhost
A Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 File Lister (its responsive too! Go ahead and try it out for yourself!). Inspired by [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com) and [this post](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/php/display-styled-directory-contents/) specifically.

##Installation

To install "A Prettified Localhost", just drop the files in the root folder of your localhost directory

If you have any problems you can [contact me](mailto:ethankr@comcast.net) or [create an issue](http://github.com/ekdevdes/a-pretty-localhost) here on Github.

##Usage
 
**Note:** This script will work with any localhost. But since I am I have a Mac, I will speak specifically to MAMP (Macintosh Apache MySQL and PHP).

Just point your browser to [http://localhost:8888/files.php](http://localhost:8888/files.php)

**Note:** The above link will only work if you actually have your localhost running on port 8888. For **MAMP** users this means that the link will only work when **MAMP** is powered up.

This script will work with any localhost. But since I am I have a Mac, I am speaking specifically to MAMP (Macintosh Apache MySQL and PHP).
